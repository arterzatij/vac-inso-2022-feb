I could not find the time to implement a user like authorization subsystem
neither a benchmarking tool. Besides that, you can find the base idea
implementation of the requirements on ./docs/domain.pdf

You can find the system implemented in htt://devartiral.com:6428/ and
installation instructions in the file installation.txt

I used swagger for the API documentation tool, which you can find in:
  htt://devartiral.com:6428/api-docs
or running the project locally.

The work flows goes like this; every retainer and ticked must be requested by
a client who must specifies to which of their potential branches must be
attended. Every branch must have a manager with contact data available for an
ease communication.

Now, having an retainer or a ticket is not enough to be attended by a
technician, you must first create a work order entity related to the retainer
or ticket and a specific technician. You can have a tracking of the current
state of the work order with the property 'status' (which values can be
pending: 1, doing: 2, paused: 3, done: 4, canceled: 5) and you can measure the
time of attention with the properties 'begining_attention_date' and
'ending_attention_date'.
